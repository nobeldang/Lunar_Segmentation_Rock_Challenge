For this problem, there is not much data engineering required as the model achieves upto 99 or even 100 percent accuracy. However, the data can engineered by using morphological featured engineering and using first dilation and then erosion techniques to fill the gap. Also a threshold can be set on different channels to concentrate more on the more nearby and clear objects. For e.g while loading an image, the blue channel of the loaded image will show large rock only in yellow color and the rest as the violet background. Now a threshold of lets say 150 can se set to only pick only those rocks who were more closer to the camera and thus would have more bluish component in them.
After picking up the more closer rocks, the datset would be more clean. And now we can close the small holes also in them using the former described method, which uses morphological features.

The model used to train is a simple model and does not use any transfer learning as we do not want to overfit out model. So that's why a custom made model is used for training.
